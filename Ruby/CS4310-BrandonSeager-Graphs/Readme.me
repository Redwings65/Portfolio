Created By: Brandon Seager

The script for the program is below MyGraph.rb and can be ran by cd'ing into the directory
and typing ruby MyGraph.rb. There are a series of comments to the right of each code line.
Please go easy on me because learning Ruby while doing this assignment was a pain in the ass.
